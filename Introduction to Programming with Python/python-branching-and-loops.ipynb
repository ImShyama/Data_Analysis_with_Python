    "## Branching with `if`, `else` and `elif`\n",
    "\n",
    "A really powerful feature of programming languages is *branching*: the ability to make decisions and execute a different set of statements based on whether one or more conditions are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `if` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, branching is done using the `if` statement, which is written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    statement1\n",
    "    statement2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `condition` can either be a variable or an expression. If the condition evaluates to `True`, then the statements within the *`if` block* are executed. Note the 4 spaces before `statement1`, `statement 2` etc. The spaces inform Python that these statements are associated with the `if` statement above. This technique of structuring code by adding spaces is called *indentation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Indentation**: Python relies heavily on *indentation* (white space before a statement) to define structure in code. This makes Python code easy to read and understand, but you can run into problems if you don't use indentation properly. Indent your code by placing the cursor at the start of the line and pressing the `Tab` key once to add 4 spaces. Pressing `Tab` again will indent the code further by 4 more spaces, and press `Shift+Tab` will reduce the indentation by 4 spaces. \n",
